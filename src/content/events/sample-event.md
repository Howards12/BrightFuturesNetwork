# Bright Futures Network — Launch Update

We’re rolling out Bright Futures Network in phases to keep things stable, fast, and easy to improve.

## What to expect in this phase
- A clean public website experience
- Clear navigation for stories, posts, and events
- A foundation that supports future features without needing a full rebuild

## What’s coming next
- More event listings and announcements
- Better content organization and search
- Improvements to the “Events” page layout and filtering

If you’re part of the team working on updates, keep notes on what you want automated later — we’ll build it in gradually.
